<h1>About</h1>

<p>
    While Developing this Website I had many issues, I mainly solved them by using https://www.w3schools.com/ which teaches you how to<br>
    program using many different programming languages. Also, I found that it was easy to find issues when I knew what the program<br>
    should look like. One issue that I had at the start which was also the most difficult to solve was adding the images, to solve this<br>
    I used https://www.w3schools.com/ to learn the syntax and checked my Syntax. After that again with images I needed to add files from<br>
    my computer, to do this I looked at the lesson on images at my teacher's recommendation I figured out what I needed to do. To add the<br>
    images I just needed to put them in the same file as the website files. To plan my website I drew what I wanted it to look like, and<br>
    I considered what colours to use. For colours I decided to spend a few minutes experimenting to find one that I thought looked good,<br>
    as for planning the website I mainly considered two things. These two things where first, where to put the navigation bar and second,<br>
    where the puzzle should be. Scheduling when to work was difficult as I often had difficulty working on anything due to the health issues I<br>
    was having while working on this. I think my website turned out alright however I do not think that it is very high quality. At best I believe<br>
    that this website will get me a 3-. I found that I didn't have enough time to work on it, not of any fault of my teacher, and found that<br>
    all the lessons I missed really brought my ability to build the website down. Personally  found this project stressful due to my own<br>
    circumstances but, I think that I would have enjoyed it if I hadn't missed so many lessons.
